# TicTacToeCLI
The code uses HashMaps to keep track of the occurrences of symbols in rows and columns, and it checks for a winner after each move. The game loop continues until there are no more moves or a winner is declared. The code is CLI-based, taking user input for row, column, and symbol for each move.
